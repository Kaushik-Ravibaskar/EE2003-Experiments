# EE2003 - Computer Organization

:loud_sound: This repository contains hands-on experiments done for the course EE2003 (Computer Organisation) 

*Note: This repository contains only the verilog source code for the experiments. It doesn't contains other files (such as testbench) required to run the simulations, nor it contains files to run it on FPGAs.*

#### These are the experiment statements on which the codes are based:

* Expt 1: Sequential Multiplier (8-bit version)

The experiment involves multiplying two 8-bit signed integers using sequential multiplication approach in Verilog using multiple cycles to perform computation.

* Expt 2: Floating point addition (32-bit version)

The goal of the experiment was to implement a floating point adder in Verilog to take 2, 32-b values as input, interpret them as IEEE-754 floating point values, and add them. All the exceptional cases were handled using some conventions which is mentioned in the code.

* Expt 3: Single Cycle Implementation using RISC-V architechture (32-bit version)

The goal of the experiment was to implement all instructions of the RV32I set to make a single cycle CPU using Verilog. (there are more details to it, would be conveyed by the instructor. Used Patterson and Henessey for architechture reference).

:rotating_light: **A word of caution. Please don't directly try to copy the source code from here. Use it for reference purpose i.e. to correct your own written code. Believe me, its a whole lot of fun doing that way. Enjoy learning :zap: :green_heart: :zap:**
